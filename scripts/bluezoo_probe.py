"""Read-only probe of a BlueZoo Data Warehouse account.

Answers one question: **what does this specific tenant's warehouse actually
look like?** — because table availability, cluster hostname, and group/sensor
configuration all vary per BlueZoo customer, and our connector has to work for
any of them (see `working-docs/bluezoo-live-verification/findings.md`).

Read-only by construction: only `list_tables`, `desc_table`, and `SELECT`
statements are ever sent (`run_query` is server-side SELECT-only regardless).
Nothing is written to BlueZoo, and the AccessKey is never printed or persisted.

Usage
-----
    # key from app/.env (BLUEZOO_ACCESS_KEY=...) or the environment
    python scripts/bluezoo_probe.py --out .docs/version2-plan/working-docs/bluezoo-live-verification/scan

    # another customer / cluster
    BLUEZOO_BASE_URL=https://<their-cluster-host>/v2/dwh python scripts/bluezoo_probe.py

Environment
-----------
    BLUEZOO_ACCESS_KEY   required. Dashboard -> Profile -> AccessKey.
    BLUEZOO_BASE_URL     optional. Defaults to the Apollo cluster host.
                         The hostname is CLUSTER-scoped, not global: a key
                         from cluster A returns BAD_TOKEN against cluster B's
                         host. The dashboard Profile screen names the cluster,
                         and each cluster issues its own AccessKey.

Cost
----
BlueZoo meters a monthly BYTES-SCANNED allowance (BigQuery style) as an abuse
guard. The ceiling is per-tenant configuration they raise on request (one live
tenant sits at 500 GB per sensor location), but the DEFAULT is 1 GB per sensor
location — low enough that ~735 MB of full-history aggregates exhausted it in
practice. Once spent, EVERY `run_query` fails until it resets or is raised,
including single-day ones. Metadata (`list_tables`, `desc_table`) and the
Real-time API are exempt. This probe therefore counts over the last
DEFAULT_WINDOW_DAYS by default; `--full-history` is an explicit opt-in and is
only safe on a tenant known to be empty.
