"""LiveBlueZooAudienceDataSource — the connected-mode conformer (Phase 11b).

ONE class implementing the seam's ONE method against BlueZoo's REST Data
Warehouse (`run_query`), plus private helpers. Deliberately NOT a framework:
one fixed parameterized SELECT against `sensor_visits`, no pagination, no
query builder, no capability probing (scope guard: the pre-kickoff decisions
at the foot of .docs/version2-plan/11-live-bluezoo-adapter.md).

Conforming rules (findings: bluezoo-live-verification Part 5 +
bluezoo-semantics-resolution):
- Read-only: SELECT-only + mandatory time predicate, both refused
  client-side before anything leaves the process.
- Named columns always — bytes scanned are metered per month; `select *`
  is the expensive mistake.
- Rule R (count only `valid` rows) is config policy (BLUEZOO_VALID_POLICY),
  logged with the row count on every read, never baked in — it is OUR
  recommendation, not yet confirmed by BlueZoo.
- `timestamp` is UTC (proven empirically); rows normalize to NAIVE UTC to
  match the play-slot convention (seed.py's UTC day buckets) — a tz-aware
  datetime would silently match nothing in the attribution join.
- Quota exhaustion is a named, non-retryable operational state; retry makes
  it worse. Bad credentials and wrong-cluster hosts get their own faces too.
- Zero rows is a legitimate result, never an error (fail-closed applies to
  configuration, not to data).
- BLUEZOO_BASE_URL has NO default: the URL is cluster-scoped and travels
  with the AccessKey as a {base_url, access_key} pair — a wrong default
  would fail looking like a bad credential.
