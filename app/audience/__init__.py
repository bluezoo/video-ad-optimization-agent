"""Audience data-source selection (Phase 11a).

APP_MODE is the only mode knob (Phase 6): demo → SyntheticAudienceDataSource;
connected → LiveBlueZooAudienceDataSource (Phase 11b), which fails closed at
construction if BlueZoo configuration is missing.

Ported from the donor factory's mechanics — lazy dotted-path registry,
thread-safe singleton, test-override seam — minus its traps: no GCS_BUCKET
coupling (the donor gated its BQ provider on an env var the provider never
used), no BigQuery-by-default, no reach-in to other services for seeding.
Entry-points packaging deliberately skipped (phase doc): the builtin dict
is the registry.
