"""Archetype registry: maps product categories to prompt archetypes (ws09, Option B).

An archetype decides which prompt template family a product uses. Adding a new
vertical = one entry in ARCHETYPE_BY_CATEGORY (or nothing at all — unknown
categories fall back to the generic "product-hero"). Phase 15 may layer an LLM
prompt-writer behind the same resolve_archetype() seam for vendor onboarding.
