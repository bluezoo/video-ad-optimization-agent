"""Shared metric computation — the ONLY place RPI math lives.

docs/METRICS.md is the authoritative definition source; this module is its
executable counterpart (Phase 4 / 04-centralize-rpi-metrics). Every tool
that returns an RPI value calls compute_rpi() instead of dividing inline;
python-level cross-row averaging of already-averaged quantities (dwell
time) goes through compute_weighted_average().

Both functions are pure arithmetic: no queries, no scoping logic. Callers
sum revenue/impressions over their own window first.
