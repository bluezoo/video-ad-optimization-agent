"""Deterministic playout-attribution join (Phase 10).

The causal chain the demo now tells truthfully:

    video_attribution windows (who was live, on which screen, when)
      -> AdPlayRecord schedule (seeded 15-min play slots per video/screen/day)
      -> join vs seed.py's screen_visits (inner counts only -> impressions)
      -> revenue = play visits x video_rpi (the demo stand-in for the PoS
         revenue lookup by product + time window)
      -> daily aggregation -> the same video_metrics rows as before.

Determinism rules (all sha256-seeded via seed._seeded_rng):
- screens_for_campaign: 2-3 screens per campaign's store; screen_id is
  ad_campaign_id * 100 + k, never the campaign id itself (the ws05 1:1
  campaign-as-screen proxy is gone).
- Play schedules are ABSOLUTE per (ad_campaign_id, video_id, screen_id, day):
  activating another creative later never changes existing videos' plays.
  Two creatives may collide on a slot — same deliberate trade-off as ws05's
  fractions summing > 1 (history immutability beats physical exclusivity).
- video_rpi survives from ws07 unchanged: per-(campaign, video), band
  [0.03, 0.07], day- and screen-independent, so each creative's
  revenue/impressions stays one checkable constant.
- Data now arrives via app/audience's AudienceDataSource (demo: seed.py
  behind the seam) — same values, same seeds.

dwell_time_seconds stays a synthetic scalar and circulation stays an
outgoing_outer-derived convention (now summed over played slots) — real
semantics are Phase 11's (docs/METRICS.md).
