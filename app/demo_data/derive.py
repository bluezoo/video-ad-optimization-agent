"""Signature-stable facade over the Phase 10 ad-play join.

Kept so both historical call sites (review_tools._insert_derived_metrics,
mock_data seed-time bulk generation) and any older DB keep working: callers
that pass real attribution windows get the honest join; callers that don't
get synthesized always-open windows across the campaign's screens — the
same rows the join produces for a video live all range on every screen.

The per-video-per-day INVENTIONS that used to live here are gone:
video_fraction is replaced by the deterministic play schedule
(attribution.slot_budget + expand_ad_plays), and the 1:1 campaign-as-screen
proxy by attribution.screens_for_campaign. campaign_uplift and video_rpi
moved to attribution.py (re-exported here unchanged).
