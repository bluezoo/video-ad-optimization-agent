"""Live integration tests: 3-dimension eval scoring via the local harness.

Each test runs its EvalSet through tests.integration.eval_harness —
inference ONCE per case against the real agent (Task 4's conftest supplies
the real Vertex env + isolated DB), then tools / trajectory / answer
dimensions scored from live_eval_config.json. assert_eval_outcomes is the
vacuity guard (Q19): zero or partial inference runs can never PASS.

All five eval sets were repaired in Phase 16 stage 4 to the real
transfer_to_agent-wrapped trajectories (ws09 discovery) and owner-approved
reference answers, so they run live and are expected to PASS — no xfail
markers remain.
